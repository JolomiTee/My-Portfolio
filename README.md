# My-Portfolio
## Note: This is not an original work. Credit goes to Sadee for the beautiful portfolio template i used.
 I've been trying to get a basic portfolio design down, so I thought of some things, but I didn't completely know about them.
 Through this portfolio template of which I actually coded along..all 3hrs+ of it while implementing my own small changes,
 I was able to grasp so much more of CSS, Javascript and HTML structuring which I didn't know before. I hope this will lead to getting me 
 a better idea or perspective on making my own original design of a Web Designers portfolio.
